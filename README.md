### Overview

In this assignment, I will make "LIRI". LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.


In this app, you can search Spotify for a song's information, such as, the artist of the song and which album the song was on. You can also
search a cool website called 'Bands In Town' to see when and where a band will be playing their next gig. And last but not least, using the IMDB/OMDB databases, you can find a bunch of info for your favorite movie.
